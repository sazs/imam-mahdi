					<h2>major signs of his coming</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Today the Muslims are eagerly waiting for the coming of Imam Mahdi (AS) but at the
						same time we should also know that are quite differences among the Muslim community relating to the
						identification of Imam Mahdi (AS), the reason being some weak and fabricated narrations and some stories heard from here and there.
						Therefore in this article it has been tried to clear these misconceptions
						and present true things about Imam Mahdi (AS) so that each and every individual of this Ummah shall not reject true Imam mahdi (AS) due
						to his/her misconceptions and thus waiting of 1400 years going in vain. </strong>
					</p>
					<h3>Hopelesssness in this Ummah</h3>
					<p>
						In hadith, it was copied from Ibn Abbas(RA) that,<cite>&quot; Mahdi (AS) will appear at the time when people being upset would say that what
							for Mahdi (AS) would come now !! &quot;</cite>
					</p>
					<h4>Inference:</h4>
					<p>
						Generally, when people gets tired of waiting for somebody’s arrival, then they get upset and say such things; the Muslims are
						waiting for Mahdi (AS) for the past 1400 years and more and even now if there is delay in his
						coming then people will surely become upset and say such things.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, today the world is filled with oppression, tyranny, dishonesty and injustice. The Muslims are making alliances
						with the enemies of Islam and thereby helping them to kill their own Muslim brothers. Naturally all this has
						made the people  upset and they have gradually began to think that now for what Mahdi(AS) would come !!
					</p>
					<p>
						Some have either began to think that Mahdi’s
						coming is very far or he will come very close to last hour. Some have even began to suspect about his coming.

					<h3>Sectism In Muslim Community And Frequent Earthquakes</h3>
					<p>
						<cite>&quot; (Mahdi) will come in my Ummah when there will be differences among the people of this
							Ummah and frequent earthquakes would appear.&quot; (<strong>majmal jawaeed</strong>)</cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hazoor (SAW) said,<cite>&quot; I give you glad tidings of Mahdi (AS) who will  come in my Ummah at the time
							of differences and helplessness. He would fill the earth with justice as it was filled with oppression and tyranny.&quot;</cite>(Musnad Ahmad)
					</p>
					<h4>inference:</h4>
					<p>
						We all are aware of the fact that today the frequency of earthquakes is very high, there is no week in
						which earthquakes do not occur. Every year we get a news of two or three large scale earthquakes in which 100 to 1000 people death occur.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also there are lot of differences among this Ummah as we can see it from the number of sects that has established in Islam. Each sect considers
						itself right and other sects to be wrong, the differences among this Ummah seen today was not seen before.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, it can be observed that the people of this Ummah are treated with inferiority in the whole world, they are oppressed and humiliated. Even the leaders of the Muslim nation are influenced by the enemies
						and thus the Muslims of this Ummah are experiencing nothing but helplessness and humiliation.

					<h3>Sanctions On Iraq And Sham</h3>
					<p>
						Abu Nadra reported: "We were in the company of Jabir bin Abdulldh that he said it may happen that the people of Iraq may not
						send their Qafiz and Dirhams (their measures of food stuff and their money). We said: Who would be responsible for it?
						He said: The non-Arabs would prevent them. He again said: There is the possibility that the people of Syria may not send their
						Dinar and Mudd. We said: Who would be responsible for it? He said This prevention would be made by the Romans.
						He (Jabir bin Abdullab) kept quiet for a while and then reported Allah's Messenger (may peas be upon him) having said
						There would be a caliph in the last(period) of my Ummah who would freely give handfuls of wealth to the people without counting it.
						I said to Abu Nadra and Abu al-'Ala: DO you mean 'Umar bin 'Abd al-Aziz? They said: No   (MUSLIM)
					</p>
					<p>
						Narrated Abu Hurayrah: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: "Iraq would withhold its dirhams and qafiz; Syria
						would withhold its mudd and dinar and Egypt would withhold its irdab and dinar and you would recoil to that position
						from where you started and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would recoil to the position
						from where you started, the bones and the flesh of Abu Hurayrah would bear testimony to it."  (MUSLIM)
					</p>
					<h4>Inference :</h4>
					<p>
						Sanctions on food and money was imposed on Iraq in 1990 by U.N. and on sham(presently Afghanistan which was a part of sham
						in Huzoor saw’s time) in 2004 by America. Here U.N. symbolises non Arabs. Today’s Christian population of America and England
						are of the Roman origin that was present during Huzoor SAW time. So Huzoor SAW prophecised them by using the word ‘Romans’.
					</p>
					<p>
						In hadith (a),  Iraq and Sham names are mentioned and in hadith (b), Egypt name is added. Both the hadiths are of Sahih muslim.
						So the narrator might have done some mistake while narrating the hadith(b) &amp; added the name of Egypt also. (Allah knows best).
						but if it is not a mistake then sanctions on Egypt would be imposed in near future.

					<h2>Death Of A Caliph</h2>
					<p>
						The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Disagreement will occur at the death of a caliph and a man of the people
						of Medina will come flying forth to Mecca. Some of the people of Mecca will come to him, bring him out against
						his will and swear allegiance to him between the Corner and the Maqam. An expeditionary force will then be sent
						against him from Syria but will be swallowed up in the desert between Mecca and Medina. When the people see that,
						the eminent saints of Syria and the best people of Iraq will come to him and swear allegiance to him between the
						Corner and the Maqam. Then there will arise a man of Quraish whose maternal uncles belong to Kalb and send against
						them an expeditionary force which will be overcome by them, and that is the expedition of Kalb. Disappointed will
						be the one who does not receive the booty of Kalb. He will divide the property, and will govern the people by the
						Sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him) and establish Islam on Earth. He will remain seven years… (Sunan Dawud)
					</p>
					<p>
						Thawban said, "The Prophet said: 'Three men will fight at the place where your treasure is.
						Each of them will be the son of a Khalifah, and none of  them will get hold of the treasure.(Ibn Majah)
					</p>
					<h2>Inference:-</h2>
					<p>
						As we know that in 1995, Inamul hasan (RA) died in the city of Delhi, India. He was the leader(Amir) of ‘tabligh jamaat’
						and was like a caliph of this Ummah because Allah has taken a huge task of Deen through him all across the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						After his death, three persons namely Saad bin Haroon bin Yusuf(RA), Zubair bin Inamul Hassan(RA)
						and Izhar(RA) were the applicants for the post of the Tabligh leader(Amir) and there was ample of dispute
						among the followers of these personalities. But later it was decided that there would be no further leader of
						this group and a ‘Majlis-e-Shura’ was established at the headquarters of this group, that is, Nizamuddin in delhi.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also one must note that being the sons of caliph doesn’t mean that they would have their fathers as caliph but it
						means that they would belong to caliph’s progeny. Hazoor (SAW) has said Ibrahim (AS) as his father in many hadiths but we
						all know that Ibrahim (AS) came 2500 years before Hazoor (SAW) and thus it means that Hazoor (SAW) belong to ibrahim (as) progeny.
						Hazoor (SAW) was the descendent of Ismail (AS) who was the son of Ibrahim (AS).
					</p>
					<p>
						So, here  the three persons belong to the caliph’s family as follows :-
						<ul>
							<li>
								Saad (RA) –grandson of Yusuf(RA), 2nd Amir of tabligh group.
							</li>
							<li>
								Zubair(RA) – son of Inamul Hassan(RA), 3rd Amir of this group.
							</li>
							<li>
								Izhar(RA) – belong to Siddique Shayyukh but it is not known as to which member of his family has Hazoor (SAW) called as the caliph.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Therefore this means that Mahdi (AS) will appear from this city(Delhi) and then move towards another city. most people think
						that Mahdi’s fleeing from Madina means Madina Munawwarah or Yathrib of Saudi Arabia but such thinking is not appropriate.
						The word ‘Madinah’ in arabic means ‘city’ as it is evident from many verses of Quran where Allah (SWT) has used ‘Madina’ for representing a city.
					</p>
					<p>
						References from Quran :
						<ul>
							<li>
								Pharoah’s city. (28;15,18,20)
							</li>
							<li>
								Lut’s city.(15;67)
							</li>
							<li>
								Egypt’s city. (12;30)  etc..
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Also if one observes all the three hadiths and assemble them together, the we would come across that Mahdi (AS) will flee
						from the city where caliph’s death occurs. Thus Mahdi (AS) will flee from Delhi to Mecca or to a place resembling Mecca geographically
						because we know that in prophecies name of place is generally not found but its geographical conditions.

					<h3>One Major Affliction On Muslim Community</h3>
					<p>
						Hadith –
					</p>
					<p>
						Prophet (SAW) said,"in the end of the time, my Ummah will undergo very hard affliction like never before,
						so that man can not find any way out. Then Allah (SWT) will make appear a person from my progeny, that is from ahlul-bayt,
						who will fill the earth with justice as it was filled with injustice. The inhabitants of the earth and the
						inhabitants of the heaven love him. The sky will bring down its water everywhere and the earth will bring all
						what it can offer and will become green all over.(hakim)"
					</p>
					<h4>Inference :-</h4>
					<p>
						Today , the kind of affliction and trial this Ummah is facing, was not seen before. In the past days,
						in order to escape from their enemies, the people had the option to move to a different place or country.
						but now due the Muslim enemies has its reach to every part of world due to the advancement in technologies. One cannot escape from their reach. So the Muslims are facing such hardships that they can’t
						find a way to get rid of their enemies oppression. Hence today the Muslims are facing these hardships which were not seen before
						and thus they are very helpless and upset with the present condition.
					</p>
					<h3>Conclusion :-</h3>
					<p>
						Therefore, if one considers all the hadiths related to this topic, then we will realise that
						certainly this is the right time for the appearance of Imam mahdi (AS) in this Ummah or he might have appeared in this Ummah.
