					<h2>MAJOR SIGNS OF HIS COMING</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>today the muslims are eagerly waiting for the coming of imam mahdi but at the
						same  we should also know that are quite differences among the muslim community relating to the
						identification of imam mahdi, the reason being some weak and fabricated narrations and some stories heard from here and there.
						therefore in this article it has been tried to clear those misconceptions
						anmd presnt true things about imam mahdi so that each and every individual of this ummah shall not reject true imam mahdi due
						to his/her misconceptions and thus waiting of 1400 years going invain. </strong>
					</p>
					<h3>HOPELESSSNESS IN THIS UMMAH</h3>
					<p>
						IN HADI, IT WAS COPIED FROM IBNE ABBAS(RA) THAT,<cite>&quot; MAHDI WILL APPEAR AT THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE BEING UPSET WOULD SAY THAT WHAT
							FOR MAHDI WOULD COME NOW !! &quot;</cite>
					</p>
					<h4>Inference:</h4>
					<p>
						when people gets tired ofwaiting for somebody’s arrival, then they get upset and say such things. the muslims are
						waiting for imam mahdi for the past 1400 years and more and even noe if there is delay in his
						coming then people will surely become upset and say such things.
					</p>
					<p>
						also, today the world is filled oppresion, tyranny, dishonesty and injustice. the muslims are making allianes
						with the enemies of islam and thereby helping them to kill their own muslim brothers. naturally all this has
						made the people  upset and they have gradually began to think that now for what mahdi would come !!
					</p>
					<p>
						so all these happenings during the period of 1400 years, the people have either bagan to think that mahdi’s
						coming is very far or he will come very close to last hour. some have even began to suspect about his coming.

					<h3>SECTISM IN MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND FREQUENT EARTHQUAKES</h3>
					<p>
						<cite>&quot; (MAHDI) WILL COME IN MY UMMAH WHEN THERE WILL BE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THIS
							UMMAH AND EARTHQUAKES WOULD APPEAR.&quot; (<strong>MAJMAL JAWAEED</strong>)</cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						HAZUR SAW SAID,<cite>&quot; I GIVE YOU GLAD TIDINGS OF MAHDI WHO WILL  COME IN MY UMMAH AT THE TIME
							OF DIFFERENCES AND HELPLESSNESS. HE WOULD FILL THE EARTH WITH JUSTICE AS IT WAS FILLED WITH OPPRESSION AND TYRANNY.&quot;</cite>(MUSNAD AHMAD)
					</p>
					<h4>Inference:</h4>
					<p>
						we all are aware of the fact that today the frequency of eartquakes is very high, there is no week in
						which eartquakes do not occur. every year we get a news of two or three large scale eartquakes in which 100 to 1000 people death occur.
					</p>
					<p>
						also there are lot of differences among this ummah as we can see it from the number of sects that has established in islam. each sect considers
						itself right and other sects to be wrong. thus the differences among this ummah seen today was not seen before.
					</p>
					<p>
						considering the helplessness of this ummah, then it can be obseved that the people of this ummah are treated with inferiority,
						in the whole world, they are oppressed and humiliated. even the leaders of the muslim nation are influenced by the enemies
						and thus the muslims of this ummah are experiencing nothing but helplessness an humiliation.

					<h3>SANCTIONS ON IRAQ AND SHAM</h3>
					<p>
						Abu Nadra reported: "We were in the company of Jabir b. 'Abdulldh that he said it may happen that the people of Iraq may not
						send their qafiz and dirhams (their measures of food stuff and their money). We said: Who would be responsible for it?
						He said: The non-Arabs would prevent them. He again said: There is the possibility that the people of Syria may not send their
						dinar and mudd. We said: Who would be responsible for it? He said This prevention would be made by the Romans.
						He (Jabir b. Abdullab) kept quiet for a while and then reported Allah's Messenger (may peas be upon him) having said
						There would be a caliph in the last(period) of my Ummah who would freely give handfuls of wealth to the people without counting it.
						I said to Abu Nadra and Abu al-'Ala: DO you mean 'Umarb. 'Abd al-Aziz? They said: No   (MUSLIM)
					</p>
					<p>
						Narrated Abu Hurayrah: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: "Iraq would withhold its dirhams and qafiz; Syria
						would withhold its mudd and dinar and Egypt would withhold its irdab and dinar and you would recoil to that position
						from where you started and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would recoil to the position
						from where you started, the bones and the flesh of Abu Hurayrah would bear testimony to it."  (MUSLIM)
					</p>
					<h4>INFERENCE :</h4>
					<p>
						SANCTIONS OF FOOD AND MONEY WAS IMPOSED ON IRAQ IN 1990 BY U.N. AND ON SHAM(PRESENTLY AFGHANISTAN WHICH WAS A PART OF SHAM
						IN HAZUR SAW’S TIME) IN 2004 BY AMERICA.HERE U.N. SYMBOLISES NON ARABS. TODAY’S CHRISTIAN POPULATION OF AMERICA AND ENGLAND
						ARE OF THE ROMAN ORIGIN THAT WAS PRESENT DURING HAZUR SAW TIME. SO HAZUR SAW PROPHECISED THEM BY USING THE WORD ‘ROMANS’.
					</p>
					<p>
						IN HADITH (A),  IRAQ AND SHAM NAMES ARE MENTIONED AND IN HADITH (B) EGYPT NAME IS ADDED. BOTH THE HADITHS ARE OF SAHIH MUSLIM.
						SO THE NARRATOR MIGHT HAVE DONE SOME MISTAKE WHILE NARRATING THE HADITH(B) &amp; ADDED THE NAME OF EGYPT ALSO. (ALLAH KNOWS BEST).
						BUT IF IT IS NOT A MISTAKE THEN SANCTIONS ON EGYPT WOULD BE IMPOSED IN NEAR FUTURE.

					<h2>DEATH OF A CALIPH</h2>
					<p>
						The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Disagreement will occur at the death of a caliph and a man of the people 
						of Medina will come flying forth to Mecca. Some of the people of Mecca will come to him, bring him out against 
						his will and swear allegiance to him between the Corner and the Maqam. An expeditionary force will then be sent 
						against him from Syria but will be swallowed up in the desert between Mecca and Medina. When the people see that, 
						the eminent saints of Syria and the best people of Iraq will come to him and swear allegiance to him between the 
						Corner and the Maqam. Then there will arise a man of Quraysh whose maternal uncles belong to Kalb and send against 
						them an expeditionary force which will be overcome by them, and that is the expedition of Kalb. Disappointed will 
						be the one who does not receive the booty of Kalb. He will divide the property, and will govern the people by the 
						Sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him) and establish Islam on Earth. He will remain seven years… (Sunan Dawud)
					</p>
					<p>
						Thawban said, "The Prophet said: 'Three men will fight at the place where your treasure is.  
						Each of them will be the son of a Khalifah, and none of  them will get hold of the treasure.(IBNE MAJAH)
					</p>
					<h2>INFERENCE:-</h2>
					<p>
						AS WE KNOW THAT IN 1995, INAMUL HASAN (RA) DIED VIN THE CITY OF DELHI, INDIA. HE WAS THE LEADER(AMIR) OF ‘TABLIGH JAMAAT’
						AND WAS LIKE A CALIPH OF THIS UMMAH BECAUSE ALLAH HAS TAKEN A HUGE TASK OF DEEN THROUGH HIM ALL  ACROSS THE WORLD.
					</p>
					<p>
						AFTER HIS DEATH, THREE PERSONS NAMELY SAAD BIN HAROON BIN YUSUF(RA), ZUBAIR BIN INAMUL HASSAN(RA)
						AND IZHAR(RA) WERE THE APPLICANTS FOR THE POST OF THE TABLIGH LEADER(AMIR) AND THERE WAS AMPLE OF DISPUTE
						AMONG THE FOLLOWERS OF THESE PERSONALITIES. BUT LATER IT WAS DECIDED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER LEADER OF
						THIS GROUP AND A ‘MAJLIS-E-SHURA’ WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THIS GROUP, THAT IS, NIZAMUDDIN IN DELHI.
					</p>
					<p>
						ALSO ONE MUST NOTE THAT BEING THE SONS OF CALIPH DOESN’T MEAN THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR FATHERS AS CALIPH BUT IT
						MEANS THAT THEY WOULD BELONG TO CALIPH’S PROGENY. HAZUR SAW HAS SAID IBRAHIM (AS) AS HIS FATHER IN MANY HADITHS BUT WE
						ALL KNOW THAT IBRAHIM AS CAME 2500 YEARS BEFIORE HAZUR SAW AND THUS IT MEANS THAT HAZUR SAW BELONG TO IBRAHIM (AS) PROGENY.
						HAZUR SAW WAS THE DESCENDENT OF ISMAIL (AS) WHO WAS THE SON OF IBRAHIM (AS).
					</p>
					<p>
						SO,HERE  THE THREE PERSONS BELONG TO THE CALIPH’S FAMILY AS FOLLOWS :-
						<ul>
							<li>
								SAAD (RA) –GRANDSON OF YUSUF(RA), 2ND AMIR OF TABLIGH GROUP.
							</li>
							<li>
								ZUBAIR(RA) – SON OF INAMUL HASSAN(RA), 3RD AMIR OF THIS GROUP.
							</li>
							<li>
								IZHAR(RA) – BELONG TO SIDDIQUE SHAYYUKH BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN AS TO WHICH MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY HAS HAZUR SAW CALLED AS THE CALIPH.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						THEREFORE THIS MEANS THAT MAHDI WILL APPEAR FROM THIS CITY(DELHI) AND THEN MOVE TOWARDS ANOTHER CITY. MOST PEOPLE THINK
						THAT MAHDI’S FLEEING FROM MADINAH MEANS MADINAH MUNAWWARAH OR YATHRIB OF SAUDI ARABIA BUT SUCH THINKING IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
						THE WORD ‘MADINAH’ IN ARABIC MEANS ‘CITY’ AS IT IS EVIDENT FROM MANY VERSES OF QURAN WHERE ALLAH HAS USED ‘MADINAH’ FOR REPRESENTING A CITY.
					</p>
					<p>
						REFERENCES FROM QURAN :
						<ul>
							<li>
								PHAROAH’S CITY. (28;15,18,20)
							</li>
							<li>
								LUT’S CITY.(15;67)
							</li>
							<li>
								EGYPT’S CITY. (12;30)  etc..
							</li>
						</ul>
					</P>
					<p>
						ALSO IF ONE OBSERVES ALL THE THREE HADITHS VAND ASSEMBLE THEM TOGETHER, THE WE WOULD COME ACROSS THAT MAHDI WILL FLEE
						FROM THE CITY WHE CALIPH’S DEATH OCCURS. THUS MAHDI WILL FLEE FROM DELHI TO MECCA OR TO A PLACE RESEMBLING MECCA GEOGRAPHICALLY
						BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN PROPHECIES NAME OF PLACE IS GENERALLY NOT FOUND BUT ITS GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS.

					<h3>ONE MAJOR AFFLICTION ON MUSLIM COMMUNITY</h3>
					<p>
						HADITH –
					</p>
					<p>
						PROPHET SAW SAID,"In the end of the time, my Ummah will undergo very hard affliction like never before, 
						so that man can not find any way out. Then Allah will appear a person from my progeny, that is my Ahlul-Bayt, 
						who will fill the earth with justice as it was filled with injustice. The inhabitants of the earth and the 
						inhabitants of the heaven love him. The sky will bring down its water everywhere and the earth will bring all 
						what it can offer and will become green all over.(HAKIM)"
					</p>
					<h4>INFERENCE :-</h4>
					<p>
						TODAY , THE KIND OF AFFLICTION AND TRIAL THIS UMMAH IS FACING, WAS NOT SEEN BEFORE. IN THE PAST DAYS, 
						INORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR ENEMIES, THE PEOPLE HAD THE OPTION TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT PLACE OR COUNTRY. 
						BUT NOW DUE TO THE ADVANCEMENT IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, THE MUSLIMS ARE FACING SUCH HARDSHIPS THAT THEY CAN’T 
						FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF THEIR ENEMIES’ OPPRESSION. TODAY, THE ADVANCED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAN SEARCH 
						ANYONE WITH THE HELP OF SATELLITES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES. SO ONE CANNOT HIDE THEMSELVES BY MOVING 
						TO DIFFERENT REGION OR COUNTRY. HENCE TODAY THE MUSLIMS ARE FACING THESE HARDSHIPS WHICH WERE NOT SEEN BEFORE 
						AND THUS THEY ARE VERY HELPLESS AND UPSET WITH THE PRESENT CONDITION.
					</p>
					<h3>CONCLUSION :-</h3>
					<p>
						THEREFORE. IF ONE CONSIDERS ALL THE HADITHS RELATED TO THIS TOPIC, THEN WE WILL REALISE THAT 
						CERTAINLY THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE APPEARANCE OF IMAM MAHDI IN THIS UMMAH OR HE MIGHT HAVE APPEARED IN THIS UMMAH.
