					<h1>Who is Imam Mahdi?</h1>
					<p>
						As we all know that Hazrat Imam Mahdi is one of the greatest signs, before the last hour.(<em>Qiayamah</em>)
						and is one of famous personalities among muslims who are eagerly waiting for his coming.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many people across the world had claimed to be Mahdi but we eventually come across that they were liars.
						due to this, the muslims got a mindset that anyone claiming Mahdi would be false only and the true one's coming is very far
					</p>
					<p>
						But such thinking is not appropiate. If Prophet (SAW) has given the news of Mahdi's (AS) arrival then he will surely
						come &amp; it is our duty to recognize him and help him as Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said in one sahih hadith:
						<cite>&quot; Helping Mahdi or following his orders is must for every muslim.&quot; - (Abu Dawood)</cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						Now the question arises as how to identify the right Mahdi &amp; to realize the time of his coming(<em>appearance</em>)??
					</p>
					<p id="read-more" class="read-more">
						The answer to this can only be found from the person who has informed the people about Mahdi's coming i.e Prophet Muhammad (SAW)
						, the last prophet of this world. So from his words, we can know the details of Mahdi.
					</p>
					<p>
						We know that the words Prophet Muhammad (SAW) are collected in the form Hadith; so in order to know about
						hazrat Mahdi (A.S),
						first we should have good knowledge about hadith it's type, it's origin etc...

					<h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
					<p>
						Hadith-
						<br />
						<br />
						<cite> The Prophet (SAW) said: &quot; The Mahdi will be of my stock, and will have a broad
							forehead a prominent nose. He will fill the earth will equity and
							justice as it was filled with oppression and tyranny, and he will rule for seven years.
							&quot; (<em> Abu Dawood</em>)</cite>
						<br />
						<br />
						<cite> The Prophet (SAW) said, &quot; His(mahdi) nose will be pointed and his face will be
							bright.&quot; (<em>Hakeem</em>)</cite>
					</p>
					<h4>INFERENCE</h4>
					<p>
						The above hadiths show that mahdi(as) will have broad forehead, pointed nose and bright face. Apart from this,
						there are many weak narrations about imam mahdi wehich are very famous among the muslims. They are that the coming mahdi
						will be of wheatish colour, medium height, light weighted body, mole on his cheek and fair look.. So the things which are
						matching are considered and the rest are rejected because to identify someone, only sahih hadith’s narration is
						the correct
						basis which are mentioned in the above hadiths.

					<h2>HIS NAME AND HIS PARENTS</h2>
					<p>
						HADITH –
						<br />
						<br />
						<cite>The Prophet (SAW) said: &quot; If only one day of this world remained. Allah would lengthen
							that day, till He raised up in it a man who belongs to me or to my family whose father's name is the same as my father's,
							who will fill the earth with equity and justice as it has been filled with oppression
							and tyranny. &quot; (<em> Abu Dawood</em>)</cite>
						<br />
						<br />
						<cite>The Prophet (SAW) said: &quot; His name will be compatible with mine, and his father’s name with my father’s name...
							&quot; (<em> Abu Dawood &amp; Tirmizi</em>)</cite>
					</p>

					<h4>Inference:</h4>
					<p>
						AS WE KNOW THAT, NAME OF A PERSON ISN’T FOUND IN GENERAL IN REGARD TO PROPHECIES. THE THING
						WE CAN GET IS HAVING ITS MEANING OR ITS QUALITATIVE NAME.
					</p>
					<p>
						HAZUR SAW HAS NOWHERE SAID IN ANY SAHIH HADITH THAT MAHDI’S NAME WILL BE MUHAMMAD BUT HAS SAID
						THAT HIS NAME WILL BE SAME AS MY NAME.
					</p>
					<p>
						HAZUR SAW’S NAME WAS MUHAMMAD FROM CHILHOOD. BUT ISA (AS) HAS PROPHECISED HIM WITH THE NAME “AHMAD”
						AS WE SEE IT IN CHAPTER SAF OF QURAN. AHMAD MEANS “THE PRAISED ONE” AND MUHAMMAD ALSO MEANS THE SAME.
						HENCE THIS PROPHECY BY ISA (AS) IS FULFILLED BY MEANING. THERE ARE ALSO MANY QUALITATIVE NAMES OF HAZUR SAW.
						SO MAHDI’S NAME COULD BE EITHER MUHAMMAD, AHMAD OR THESE COULD BE INCLUDED IN HIS NAME AS WE SEE THIS
						IN INDIA THAT PARENTS MOSTLY KEEP MUHAMMAD OR AHMAD AS THEIR SON’S NAME AND TO DIFFERENTIATE ONE FROM
						THE OTHER THEY ADD A QUALITATIVE NAME TO THIS OR IF THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS FACT, THEN THEY ADD ANY
						NAME TO DIFFERENTIATE ONE FROM THE OHER. EX- MUHAMMAD SALIM, MUHAMMAD SALMAN, AFROZ AHMAD, ETC.. SO IF MAHDI(AS)
						IS TO COME FROM INDIA THEN HE COULD ALSO HAVE SUCH NAME.
					</p>
					<p>
						AS FAR AS HIS FATHER’S NAME IS CONCERNED, NOWHERE HAS HAZUR SAW SAID THAT MAHDI’S FATHER’S
						NAME WILL BE “ABDULLAH” BUT HE SAW SAID THAT MAHDI’S FATHER’S NAME WILL BE SAME AS HIS FATHER’S NAME.
					</p>
					<p>
						THE REAL FATHER OF HAZUR SAW BUT ON MANY OCCASIONS HAZUR SAW CALLED HAZRAT IBRAHIM AS HIS FATHER
						AS HAZUR SAW BELONGS TO IBRAHIM (AS) PROGENY. THE VARIOUS HADITHS CALLING IBRAHIM (AS) AS
						HIS FATHER ARE AS FOLLOWS :-
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							HAZUR SAW SAID,<cite>” I AM THE PRODUCT OF MY FATHER IBRAHIM’S (AS) SUPPLICATION,”</cite>
						</li>
						<li>
							ON THE OCCASION OF EID-UL-ZOHA, HAZUR SAW SAID,<cite>”
								THIS(SACRIFICE OF EID-UL-ZOHA) IS THE TRADITION OF MY FATHER IBRAHIM(AS).”</cite>
						</li>
						<li>
							ON REFERRIN A PARTICULAR SUPPLICATION, HAZUR SAW,<cite>” THIS SUPPLICATION WAS
								DONE BY MY FATHER IBRAHIM(AS)….. ON HIS TWO SONS.”</cite>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						ALSO, WHEN HAZUR SAW WENT ON THE SEVEN HEAVENS ON THE NIGHT OF MERAJ, THEN EVERY PROPHET GREETED HIM
						BY SAYING, “ WELCOME ! RIGHTEOUS PROPHET “ BUT IBRAHIM(AS) SAID, “WELCOME ! RIGHTEOUS PROPHET, RIGHTEOUS SON”.
					</p>
					<p>
						SO FROM THESE POINTS WE COME TO KNOW THAT MAHDI’S FATHER NAME COULD BE ABDULLAH OR IBRAHIM(AS HAZUR SAW
						CALLED HIM HIS FATHER) OR ANY QUALITATIVE NAME OF IBRAHIM(AS) OR NAMES SIMILAR IN MEANING TO ABDULLAH OR IBRAHIM.
						IBRAHIM(AS) HAS TWO QUALITATIVE NAME BY WHICH ALLAH HAS CALLED HIM IN QURAN.
						THEY ARE KHALILULLAH AND HANIF. SO MAHDI’S FATHER’S NAME COULD BE ANY OF THESE TWO NAMES ALSO.

					<h3>HIS PROGENY </h3>
					<p>
						HADITH –
						<br />
						<br />
						<cite>Al-Mahdi is one of us, the members of the household(<b>Ahlul-Bayt</b>). -(<em> Sunan Ibn Majah</em>)</cite>
						<br />
						<br />
						<cite>The Mahdi will be of my family, of the descendants of Fatima (the Prophet's daughter). -
							(<em> Abu Dawood &amp; Tirmizi</em>)</cite>
						<cite>The earth will be filled with injustice and corruption. At that time, a man from among my
							progeny will rise and will rule for seven or nine years and will fill the earth with justice and equity.
							(<em>Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad</em>)</cite>
					</p>
					<h4>INFERENCE :</h4>
					<p>
						HE WILL BELONG TO HAZUR SAW’S FAMILY OR HIS PROGENY. HAZUR SAW HAS SAID IRANIAN AS HIS PROGENY PEOPLE.
						THEREFORE HE COULD ALSO BELONG TO IRANIAN DESCENDENT. BUT TODAY IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY WHETHER
						THE PERSON’S PROGENY BELONG TO HAZUR SAW OR HASSAN OR HUSSAIN(RA) BECAUSE PEOPLE RARELY KEEP THE DETAILS
						OF THEIR PROGENY AND HENCE IT IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY MAHDI ON THE BASIS OF PROGENY. BUT ONE CAN EASILY
						IDENTIFY HIM ON OTHER CRITERIAS OF HIS IDENTIFICATION.
					</p>
					<p>
						APART FROM THESE, IT HAS BEEN ALSO PROPHECISED THAT MAHDI WILL INTRODUCE THE SUNNAH OF HAZUR SAW
						AND WILL BE MADE RIGHTEOUS IN ONE NIGHT BY ALLAH.
