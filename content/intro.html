					<h1>Who is Imam Mahdi?</h1>
					<p>
						As we all know that Hazrat Imam Mahdi is one of the greatest signs, before the last hour.(<em>Qiayamah</em>)
						and is one of famous personalities among muslims who are eagerly waiting for his coming.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many people across the world had claimed to be Mahdi but we eventually come across that they were liars.
						due to this, the muslims got a mindset that anyone claiming Mahdi would be false only and the true one's coming is very far
					</p>
					<p>
						But such thinking is not appropiate. If Prophet (SAW) has given the news of Mahdi's (AS) arrival then he will surely
						come &amp; it is our duty to recognize him and help him as Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said in one sahih hadith:
						<cite>&quot; Helping Mahdi or following his orders is must for every muslim.&quot; - (Abu Dawood)</cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						Now the question arises as how to identify the right Mahdi &amp; to realize the time of his coming(<em>appearance</em>)??
					</p>
					<p id="read-more" class="read-more">
						The answer to this can only be found from the person who has informed the people about Mahdi's coming i.e Prophet Muhammad (SAW)
						, the last prophet of this world. So from his words, we can know the details of Mahdi.
					</p>
					<p>
						We know that the words Prophet Muhammad (SAW) are collected in the form Hadith; so in order to know about hazrat Mahdi (A.S),
						first we should have good knowledge about hadith it's type, it's origin etc...
					</p>
					<h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
					<p>
						Hadith- <br /> <br /><cite>  The Prophet (SAW) said: &quot; The Mahdi will be of my stock, and will have a broad 
								forehead a prominent nose. He will fill the earth will equity and 
								justice as it was filled with oppression and tyranny, and he will rule for seven years. &quot; (<em>  Abu Dawood</em>)</cite>
								<br /> <br /><cite>  The Prophet (SAW) said, &quot; His(mahdi) nose will be pointed and his face will be bright.&quot; (<em>Hakeem</em>)</cite>
					</p>
					<h4>INFERENCE</h4>
					<p>The above hadiths show that mahdi(as) will have broad forehead, pointed nose and bright face. Apart from this,
						 there are many weak narrations about imam mahdi wehich are very famous among the muslims. They are that the coming mahdi 
						 will be of wheatish colour, medium height, light weighted body, mole on his cheek and fair look.. So the things which are 
						 matching are considered and the rest are rejected because to identify someone, only sahih hadith’s narration is the correct 
						 basis which are mentioned in the above hadiths.

					<h2>HIS NAME AND HIS PARENTS</h2>
					<p>HADITH – <br /><br /> <cite>The Prophet (SAW) said: &quot; If only one day of this world remained. Allah would lengthen 
						that day, till He raised up in it a man who belongs to me or to my family whose father's name is the same as my father's, 
						who will fill the earth with equity and justice as it has been filled with oppression and tyranny. &quot; (<em>  Abu Dawood</em>)</cite>
						<br /><br /> <cite>The Prophet (SAW) said: &quot; His name will be compatible with mine, and his father’s name with my father’s name...
							&quot; (<em>  Abu Dawood &amp; Tirmizi</em>)</cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Inference:</h4>
					<p>
						AS WE KNOW THAT, NAME OF A PERSON ISN’T FOUND IN GENERAL IN REGARD TO PROPHECIES. THE THING WE CAN GET IS HAVING ITS MEANING OR ITS QUALITATIVE NAME. 
HAZUR SAW HAS NOWHERE SAID IN ANY SAHIH HADITH THAT MAHDI’S NAME WILL BE MUHAMMAD BUT HAS SAID THAT HIS NAME WILL BE SAME AS MY NAME.
HAZUR SAW’S NAME WAS MUHAMMAD FROM CHILHOOD. BUT ISA (AS) HAS PROPHECISED HIM WITH THE NAME “AHMAD” AS WE SEE IT IN CHAPTER SAF OF QURAN. AHMAD MEANS “THE PRAISED ONE” AND MUHAMMAD ALSO MEANS THE SAME. HENCE THIS PROPHECY BY ISA (AS) IS FULFILLED BY MEANING. THERE ARE ALSO MANY QUALITATIVE NAMES OF HAZUR SAW. SO MAHDI’S NAME COULD BE EITHER MUHAMMAD, AHMAD OR THESE COULD BE INCLUDED IN HIS NAME AS WE SEE THIS IN INDIA THAT PARENTS MOSTLY KEEP MUHAMMAD OR AHMAD AS THEIR SON’S NAME AND TO DIFFERENTIATE ONE FROM THE OTHER THEY ADD A QUALITATIVE NAME TO THIS OR IF THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS FACT, THEN THEY ADD ANY NAME TO DIFFERENTIATE ONE FROM THE OHER. EX- MUHAMMAD SALIM, MUHAMMAD SALMAN, AFROZ AHMAD, ETC.. SO IF MAHDI(AS) IS TO COME FROM INDIA THEN HE COULD ALSO HAVE SUCH NAME.
AS FAR AS HIS FATHER’S NAME IS CONCERNED, NOWHERE HAS HAZUR SAW SAID THAT MAHDI’S FATHER’S NAME WILL BE “ABDULLAH” BUT HE SAW SAID THAT MAHDI’S FATHER’S NAME WILL BE SAME AS HIS FATHER’S NAME.
ABDULLAHWAS THE REAL FATHER OF HAZUR SAW BUT ON MANY OCCASIONS HAZUR SAW CALLED HAZRAT IBRAHIM AS HIS FATHER AS HAZUR SAW BELONGS TO IBRAHIM (AS) PROGENY. THE VARIOUS HADITHS CALLING IBRAHIM (AS) AS HIS FATHER ARE AS FOLLOWS :-
1.	HAZUR SAW SAID,” I AM THE PRODUCT OF MY FATHER IBRAHIM’S (AS) SUPPLICATION,”
2.	ON THE OCCASION OF EID-UL-ZOHA, HAZUR SAW SAID,” THIS(SACRIFICE OF EID-UL-ZOHA) IS THE TRADITION OF MY FATHER IBRAHIM(AS).”
3.	ON REFERRIN A PARTICULAR SUPPLICATION, HAZUR SAW,” THIS SUPPLICATION WAS DONE BY MY FATHER IBRAHIM(AS)….. ON HIS TWO SONS.” 
ALSO, WHEN HAZUR SAW WENT ON THE SEVEN HEAVENS ON THE NIGHT OF MERAJ, THEN EVERY PROPHET GREETED HI BY SAYING, “ WELCOME ! RIGHTEOUS PROPHET “ BUT IBRAHIM(AS) SAID, “WELCOME ! RIGHTEOUS PROPHET, RIGHTEOUS SON”.
SO FROM THESE POINTS WE COME TO KNOW THAT MAHDI’S FATHER NAME COULD BE ABDULLAH OR IBRAHIM(AS HAZUR SAW CALLED HIM HIS FATHER) OR ANY QUALITATIVE NAME OF IBRAHIM(AS) OR NAMES SIMILAR IN MEANING TO ABDULLAH OR IBRAHIM. IBRAHIM(AS) HAS TWO QUALITATIVE NAME BY WHICH ALLAH HAS CALLED HIM IN QURAN. THEY ARE KHALILULLAH AND HANIF. SO MAHDI’S FATHER’S NAME COULD BE ANY OF THESE TWO NAMES ALSO.

					<h3>SANCTIONS ON IRAQ AND SHAM</h3>
					<p>
						Abu Nadra reported: "We were in the company of Jabir b. 'Abdulldh that he said it may happen that the people of Iraq may not
						send their qafiz and dirhams (their measures of food stuff and their money). We said: Who would be responsible for it?
						He said: The non-Arabs would prevent them. He again said: There is the possibility that the people of Syria may not send their
						dinar and mudd. We said: Who would be responsible for it? He said This prevention would be made by the Romans.
						He (Jabir b. Abdullab) kept quiet for a while and then reported Allah's Messenger (may peas be upon him) having said
						There would be a caliph in the last(period) of my Ummah who would freely give handfuls of wealth to the people without counting it.
						I said to Abu Nadra and Abu al-'Ala: DO you mean 'Umarb. 'Abd al-Aziz? They said: No   (MUSLIM)
					</p>
					<p>
						Narrated Abu Hurayrah: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: "Iraq would withhold its dirhams and qafiz; Syria
						would withhold its mudd and dinar and Egypt would withhold its irdab and dinar and you would recoil to that position
						from where you started and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would recoil to the position
						from where you started, the bones and the flesh of Abu Hurayrah would bear testimony to it."  (MUSLIM)
					</p>
					<h4>INFERENCE :</h4>
					<p>
						SANCTIONS OF FOOD AND MONEY WAS IMPOSED ON IRAQ IN 1990 BY U.N. AND ON SHAM(PRESENTLY AFGHANISTAN WHICH WAS A PART OF SHAM
						IN HAZUR SAW’S TIME) IN 2004 BY AMERICA.HERE U.N. SYMBOLISES NON ARABS. TODAY’S CHRISTIAN POPULATION OF AMERICA AND ENGLAND
						ARE OF THE ROMAN ORIGIN THAT WAS PRESENT DURING HAZUR SAW TIME. SO HAZUR SAW PROPHECISED THEM BY USING THE WORD ‘ROMANS’.
					</p>
					<p>
						IN HADITH (A),  IRAQ AND SHAM NAMES ARE MENTIONED AND IN HADITH (B) EGYPT NAME IS ADDED. BOTH THE HADITHS ARE OF SAHIH MUSLIM.
						SO THE NARRATOR MIGHT HAVE DONE SOME MISTAKE WHILE NARRATING THE HADITH(B) &amp; ADDED THE NAME OF EGYPT ALSO. (ALLAH KNOWS BEST).
						BUT IF IT IS NOT A MISTAKE THEN SANCTIONS ON EGYPT WOULD BE IMPOSED IN NEAR FUTURE.

					<h2>DEATH OF A CALIPH</h2>
					<p>
						The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Disagreement will occur at the death of a caliph and a man of the people
						of Medina will come flying forth to Mecca. Some of the people of Mecca will come to him, bring him out against
						his will and swear allegiance to him between the Corner and the Maqam. An expeditionary force will then be sent
						against him from Syria but will be swallowed up in the desert between Mecca and Medina. When the people see that,
						the eminent saints of Syria and the best people of Iraq will come to him and swear allegiance to him between the
						Corner and the Maqam. Then there will arise a man of Quraysh whose maternal uncles belong to Kalb and send against
						them an expeditionary force which will be overcome by them, and that is the expedition of Kalb. Disappointed will
						be the one who does not receive the booty of Kalb. He will divide the property, and will govern the people by the
						Sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him) and establish Islam on Earth. He will remain seven years… (Sunan Dawud)
					</p>
					<p>
						Thawban said, "The Prophet said: 'Three men will fight at the place where your treasure is.
						Each of them will be the son of a Khalifah, and none of  them will get hold of the treasure.(IBNE MAJAH)
					</p>
					<h2>INFERENCE:-</h2>
					<p>
						AS WE KNOW THAT IN 1995, INAMUL HASAN (RA) DIED VIN THE CITY OF DELHI, INDIA. HE WAS THE LEADER(AMIR) OF ‘TABLIGH JAMAAT’
						AND WAS LIKE A CALIPH OF THIS UMMAH BECAUSE ALLAH HAS TAKEN A HUGE TASK OF DEEN THROUGH HIM ALL  ACROSS THE WORLD.
					</p>
					<p>
						AFTER HIS DEATH, THREE PERSONS NAMELY SAAD BIN HAROON BIN YUSUF(RA), ZUBAIR BIN INAMUL HASSAN(RA)
						AND IZHAR(RA) WERE THE APPLICANTS FOR THE POST OF THE TABLIGH LEADER(AMIR) AND THERE WAS AMPLE OF DISPUTE
						AMONG THE FOLLOWERS OF THESE PERSONALITIES. BUT LATER IT WAS DECIDED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER LEADER OF
						THIS GROUP AND A ‘MAJLIS-E-SHURA’ WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THIS GROUP, THAT IS, NIZAMUDDIN IN DELHI.
					</p>
					<p>
						ALSO ONE MUST NOTE THAT BEING THE SONS OF CALIPH DOESN’T MEAN THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR FATHERS AS CALIPH BUT IT
						MEANS THAT THEY WOULD BELONG TO CALIPH’S PROGENY. HAZUR SAW HAS SAID IBRAHIM (AS) AS HIS FATHER IN MANY HADITHS BUT WE
						ALL KNOW THAT IBRAHIM AS CAME 2500 YEARS BEFIORE HAZUR SAW AND THUS IT MEANS THAT HAZUR SAW BELONG TO IBRAHIM (AS) PROGENY.
						HAZUR SAW WAS THE DESCENDENT OF ISMAIL (AS) WHO WAS THE SON OF IBRAHIM (AS).
					</p>
					<p>
						SO,HERE  THE THREE PERSONS BELONG TO THE CALIPH’S FAMILY AS FOLLOWS :-
						<ul>
							<li>
								SAAD (RA) –GRANDSON OF YUSUF(RA), 2ND AMIR OF TABLIGH GROUP.
							</li>
							<li>
								ZUBAIR(RA) – SON OF INAMUL HASSAN(RA), 3RD AMIR OF THIS GROUP.
							</li>
							<li>
								IZHAR(RA) – BELONG TO SIDDIQUE SHAYYUKH BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN AS TO WHICH MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY HAS HAZUR SAW CALLED AS THE CALIPH.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						THEREFORE THIS MEANS THAT MAHDI WILL APPEAR FROM THIS CITY(DELHI) AND THEN MOVE TOWARDS ANOTHER CITY. MOST PEOPLE THINK
						THAT MAHDI’S FLEEING FROM MADINAH MEANS MADINAH MUNAWWARAH OR YATHRIB OF SAUDI ARABIA BUT SUCH THINKING IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
						THE WORD ‘MADINAH’ IN ARABIC MEANS ‘CITY’ AS IT IS EVIDENT FROM MANY VERSES OF QURAN WHERE ALLAH HAS USED ‘MADINAH’ FOR REPRESENTING A CITY.
					</p>
					<p>
						REFERENCES FROM QURAN :
						<ul>
							<li>
								PHAROAH’S CITY. (28;15,18,20)
							</li>
							<li>
								LUT’S CITY.(15;67)
							</li>
							<li>
								EGYPT’S CITY. (12;30)  etc..
							</li>
						</ul>
					</P>
					<p>
						ALSO IF ONE OBSERVES ALL THE THREE HADITHS VAND ASSEMBLE THEM TOGETHER, THE WE WOULD COME ACROSS THAT MAHDI WILL FLEE
						FROM THE CITY WHE CALIPH’S DEATH OCCURS. THUS MAHDI WILL FLEE FROM DELHI TO MECCA OR TO A PLACE RESEMBLING MECCA GEOGRAPHICALLY
						BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN PROPHECIES NAME OF PLACE IS GENERALLY NOT FOUND BUT ITS GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS.

					<h3>ONE MAJOR AFFLICTION ON MUSLIM COMMUNITY</h3>
					<p>
						HADITH –
					</p>
					<p>
						PROPHET SAW SAID,"In the end of the time, my Ummah will undergo very hard affliction like never before,
						so that man can not find any way out. Then Allah will appear a person from my progeny, that is my Ahlul-Bayt,
						who will fill the earth with justice as it was filled with injustice. The inhabitants of the earth and the
						inhabitants of the heaven love him. The sky will bring down its water everywhere and the earth will bring all
						what it can offer and will become green all over.(HAKIM)"
					</p>
					<h4>INFERENCE :-</h4>
					<p>
						TODAY , THE KIND OF AFFLICTION AND TRIAL THIS UMMAH IS FACING, WAS NOT SEEN BEFORE. IN THE PAST DAYS,
						INORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR ENEMIES, THE PEOPLE HAD THE OPTION TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT PLACE OR COUNTRY.
						BUT NOW DUE TO THE ADVANCEMENT IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, THE MUSLIMS ARE FACING SUCH HARDSHIPS THAT THEY CAN’T
						FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF THEIR ENEMIES’ OPPRESSION. TODAY, THE ADVANCED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAN SEARCH
						ANYONE WITH THE HELP OF SATELLITES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES. SO ONE CANNOT HIDE THEMSELVES BY MOVING
						TO DIFFERENT REGION OR COUNTRY. HENCE TODAY THE MUSLIMS ARE FACING THESE HARDSHIPS WHICH WERE NOT SEEN BEFORE
						AND THUS THEY ARE VERY HELPLESS AND UPSET WITH THE PRESENT CONDITION.
					</p>
					<h3>CONCLUSION :-</h3>
					<p>
						THEREFORE. IF ONE CONSIDERS ALL THE HADITHS RELATED TO THIS TOPIC, THEN WE WILL REALISE THAT
						CERTAINLY THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE APPEARANCE OF IMAM MAHDI IN THIS UMMAH OR HE MIGHT HAVE APPEARED IN THIS UMMAH.
