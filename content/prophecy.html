				<h2>WHAT IS HADITH?</h2>
				<p><cite>Reported sayings or actions or traditions of Mohammad (Peace be upon him) , together 
					with the tradition of its chain of transmission that are not part of the Qur'an.</cite></p>
					<p>People during Huzoor SAW’s time and even 100-200 years after SAW used to memorize 
						his sayings and writing of Hadith was not common at that time.</p>
					<p>As Huzoor SAW left ,many wicked people began to say false things by adding the 
						name of Huzoor SAW,so that they could please the kings and in
						 this way ,the sayings of Huzoor SAW got mixed with false things.</p>
					<p>So few people came forward and decided that the words of Huzoor SAW should reach the people in its pure form without 
						any mixing .Thus the words of Huzoor SAW were recorded in the form of books and the Sahih Hadith was established.</p>
					<p>Sahih Hadith is like a ‘meter’ (STANDARD PARAMETER) for the people to know the 
						correct Hadiths.The narrators of this categoryof Hadith were pious and strong. So all other category of 
						Hadiths are judged based on this ‘meter’ only. If the content is more in 
						other Hadith compared to the Sahih Hadith,then they are remove or not considered.</p>
					<p>Sahih Hadith were collected by six pious people namely – Bukhari,Muslim,Tirmizi,Abu Dawood,
						Nisai,Ibne Majah.These were the people who decided to deliver Huzoor SAW words in its original form 
						without any mixing and on the basis of sound narrators.</p>
					<p>The collections gathered by these people were named after their 
						name and later was collectively termed as six Authentic Hadiths or simply “Sahahe Sitta”</p>
					<p>Till now the status of these six books are above all the other Hadith books written before or after it .
						The reason being that the muhaddith(hadith expert) of these Hadiths got the narrators whose chain finally 
						reached Huzoor SAW.After these six books ,the remaining muhaddith(hadith expert) didn’t get such narrations 
						and the hadith collected by them were picked from Sahih hadith  (Sahahe Sitta) or from 
						books being written before Sahae Sitta.
						The later Hadiths also contain some weak 
						narrations which  were omitted by either Sahae Sitta or books before them.</p>
					<p>That is why the muslim community gives priority to sahae sitta over all Hadith Books &amp;
						 thus ‘ Sahae Sitta’ is a standard parameter for the checking of hadiths.</p>
					<p>Also, the book which is given priority after ‘sahae Sitta’ is Musnad Ahmed collectred b y Ahmed bin Hanbal. 
						He was 30 years older than Bukhari &amp;
						 has written Musnad Ahmed before ‘ Sahae Sitta’.</p>
					<p>But it was not included in the sahahe sitta as it contained many weak narrations.but after sahahe sitta, 
						this book is preferred over other books as it was written close to hazur saw ‘s time.</p>
					<p>The rest of hadith books like hakim, tibrani, durre mansoor, kanzul amaal, mishkat etc 
						were written 200-700 years later compared to sahahe sitta. Hence the amount of weak narrations is 
						more as they were collected long after hazur saw’s time and also one can’t get the narrators whose chain 
						can reach hazur saw. So these books contain many weak and fabricated narrations.</p>
					<p>Now, it is clear that no one has the right to challlenge the hadiths mentioned in books other than 
						sahahe sitta against that of sahahe sitta and thus 
						to obtain the words of hazur saw, the best hadith book is “sahahe sitta”.</p>

			<div id="sub-content2" class="sub-article">
				<h2>PRIORITY LEVEL AMONG SAHAE SITTA?</h2>
				<p>There are priority levels among sahahe sitta also.bukhari is 
					given top priority followed by muslim, tirmizi, abu dawood, nisai and finally ibne majah</p>
				<p>If there are similar narrations mentioned in all the six books with little bit of change of words , then the 
					narration of bukhari would be preferred. Similarly, if there are similar narrations mentioned in 
					muslim, tirmizi, abu dawood then muslim’s narration is preferred. Ibne majah’s narration is preferred only 
					when thiis kind of narration is not present in any of the remaining five books.</p>
				<p>These are the general guidelines followed by the muslim community regarding the understanding of hadiths.
				<p>Hadiths are broadly classified into two types :
					<ul><li>Hadith based on deeds(aamaal).</li>
						<li>Hadiths based on prophecy.</li>
					</ul></p>
				<p>So naturally inorder to know about imam mahdi, we have to look into the hadiths based on prophecies.

				<h2>What is Prophecy?</h2>
				<p>So naturally inorder to know about imam mahdi, we have to look into the hadiths based on prophecies.</p>
				<p>References :</p>
				<p>Since prophecies are the events that will happen in future, therefore they are knowledge of unseen.</p>
				<p>From where to obtain prophecy?</p>
				<p>The rule followed is same as that of any general hadith understanding, 
					that is obtain it from sahahe sitta. But there are some exceptions.</p>
				<p>exceptions :</p>
				<p>Suppose if a prophecy is mentioned in one of the weak hadiths and it gets fulfilled, 
					then that weak narration is considered strong because prophecies are knowledge of unseen 
					and so if the narration was not correct then it would not have got fulfilled. Investigation is the 
					result of human effort which sometimes may be incorrect. But this happens rarely that instead of sahih hadith, 
					narration of weak hadith gets fulfilled. </p>
				<p>If there are same prophecies mentioned in any sahih hadith, pointing to
					 the same event but slight variation of words then if anyone of 
					the hadith gets fulfilled then that prophecy is considered to be fulfilled.</p>
				<p><strong>Note :</strong><br />
					One cannot challenge any prophecy of weak hadith against sahih hadith. That is, 
					if there is a prophecy of an event present in both sahih hadith and weak hadith and 
					ifonly the sahih hadith’s prophecies gets fulfilled, then one cannot that the prophecy is not
					 fulfilled because weak hadith’s narration has not been fulfilled. If the narration is fulfilled 
					 in sahih hadith, then the prophecy is fulfilled irrespective of the fact that whether it has been 
					 fulfilled in weak narration or not.but if the weak hadith’s narration gets fulfilled alongwith 
					 sahih hadith, then it can be mentioned while describing the completion of the prophecy.
				</p>
					
				<p>One even cannot guarantee that the given hadith will happen in the way he has interpreted because prophecies 
					are the knowledge of the unseen and before its happening one can only assume that it might happen in this way 
					but cannot tell with full confidence that it will happen in the way he assumed. For example, hazur saw was prophecised 
					by moses (as) in torah that “surely he will come near faran mountain with 10000 pious men and having a sparkling law in
					 his right hand.” Now by reading the above prophecy one can assume that he might come near faran mountain but one cannot 
					 say it with certainty because we know that in prophecy name of place doesn’t generally match. And this was happened in this 
					 case also. Hazur saw came in mecca which is a mountaineous region but nowhere in mecca was a mountain called faran during 
					 hazur saw time. Hence we can only assume about the occurance of a prophecy but cannot tell it with certainty.those who 
					 try to say it with certaity then they are claiming that they have knowledge of the unseen. Only allah knows the unseen  
					 and his prophets know only that portion of unssen which allah has revealed to them. Apart from them from quran and sahih 
					 hadith we come to know that satan can steal a portion of the unseen and then feed it into the ears of fortune-teller and 
					 thereby he mixes it with hundreds of false talks and say to people.  Thus if a person is arguing that the prophecy will be 
					 fulfilled as per his assumption then he is claiming that he is either a prophet, satan or a fortune-teller.
					  And if not all these,then he surely is a liar.</p>

				<h2>KNOWLEDGE OF PROPHECIES</h2>
				<p>Now, to understand a Hadith related to prophesies, we have to understand certain fact:</p>
				<h3 id="sub-prophecy1">Contradiction in the names of individuals in prophecies:</h3>
				<p>Often the name of the individual that has figured out in prophesies does not match when prophesies are unfolded.However, 
					sometimes meanings of the name matches or sometimes qualities, which the name signifies, matches.</p>
				<p><em>Example:</em><br /><li>
					Once Umar(RA) asked the Father of the church,<i>&quot; Is there anything related to me written in your Book?&quot;</i>
					<br />Father replied that in his Book, he(Umar) has been prophesized by the name 
					KARAN, which means strong, strict &amp; trustworthy.
					 And, as all of us know, these qualities were found in Umar(RA).</li>
					<li>b)	Similarly, HAZRAT Muhammad(SAW) has been prophesized by the name, ‘PARACLET’. Paraclet is a Hebrew word which means 
						praiseworthy. And Muhammad, which is an Arabic word, also  means praiseworthty.</li>
				</p>Thus from the above two examples, it is clear that sometimes meanings 
				of the name matches or sometimes qualities, which the name signifies, matches.
				<h3 id="sub-prophecy2">Place: Generally it is difficult to figure out places in the prophecies.</h3>
				<p> This is because of many reasons; out of which some are listed below:</p>
				<li><h5>Generally names of places keep on changing with time. E.g. Earlier ‘Patna was called ‘Patliputra’.</h5>
					<p>Similarly, today’s Christian population what we see around the world (in America, Australia etc.) are generally 
						from the same race who were called ‘Roomie’ at the time of Huzoor (SAW). So,
						Huzoor (SAW) has prophesized these today’s Christian population by the name, ‘Roomie’.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5>With time new countries are coming into existence:</h5>
					<p>For example, 100 years back, Pakistan, India &amp; Bangladesh all were one.Now suppose, if someone at 
						that time has prophesized about Pakistan &amp; Bangladesh war wherein India has helped Bangladesh in
						two different ways: in one place like, “Indian Military would fight with Bengalis”; and 
						in another place like, “Indian Military would help the Bengalis”.</p>
					<p>Then People at that time would not have, even in their dream, thought that the above two 
						prophesies were about the same war: where at one place ‘Indian military’ refers to 
						today’s Pak army; and at other place ‘Indian military’ refers to today’s Indian army.</p>
					<p>From the above two points a &amp; b, it has become clear that it is better to give attention on the 
						‘Geographical condition’ rather than on the names of the places in the prophesies.</p>
				</li>
				<h3 id="sub-prophecy3">Many a times, Prophesies about a City or Nation, which had not came into existence,
					 have been done by name of other city or nation( that existed &amp; was famous at the time of prophesy).</h3>
				<p>For E.g.- As we know Kuwait didn’t exists at the time of Huzoor(SAW). Kuwait has come into existence 
					in 17th century only. This is a small country the one side of which is in the land 
					and the other is in the sea. Its geographical condition matches with that of Constantinople.</p>
					<p>Therefore, at some places, prophesies about Kuwait has been done by the name of Constantinople.</p>
				<p>initially the place of migration (Hizrat) was kept in secret to Huzoor (SAW) but later on when the time of 
					migration came, the place name was made clear to him at that time only.</p>
				<p>The Prophet said,<cite> &quot; I saw in a dream that I was migrating from Mecca to a land where 
					there were date palm trees. I thought that it might be the land of 
					Al-Yamama or Hajar, but behold, it turned out to be Yathrib (i.e. Medina).&quot;</cite>[<b>Bukhari</b>].</p>
				<p>Important Observation:</p>
				<p>From the above discussion it became very clear that if a prophesy is unfolding in every aspect &amp; 
					only contradiction in name of a person  is found, then in that situation, it is better 
					to give attention to the meaning of name or to the qualities which it signifies.</p>
				<p>Moreover one more point came to our notice that something in prophesies are kept 
					secret so that each event shall happen at their respective time.</p>
				<h3 id="sub-prophecy4">TAMSEEL (METAPHORS) IN HADITH</h3>
				<p>One more difficulty in understanding hadith is that many things in prophesies
					 are told in metaphors. Because of this metaphoric narration,
					 sometimes it become very difficult to recognise things, even after it has happened.</p>
				<p>For E.g. Huzoor(SAW), at various places, himself has prophesized many things in metaphors.</p>
				<li>Aisha(RA) narrated:
					<p><cite>The prophet(SAW) said, &quot; perhaps Allah will clothe you with a shirt, Uthman, 
						and if people want you to take it off, don’t take it off for them.&quot;</cite></p>
					<p>If Usman(Peace Be upon him) has taken its literal meaning then he would not have changed his 
						attire for his entire life, but this hadith is metaphoric. kamiz has been used as a metaphor
						 for Khilafat. So, when Usman(Peace Be upon him) got his khilafat and at the time 
						 when some people wanted to kill him and revered Sahabas told him to leave khilafat, 
						then at that time, he realised the meaning of prophesy related to him &amp; 
						didnt quit Khilafat. (Ibn Majah &amp; Tirmidih)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Some of the wives of the Prophet asked him, "Who amongst us will be the first to follow you (i.e. die after you)?" 
					He said, "Whoever has the longest hand." So they started measuring their hands with a stick and Sauda's 
					hand turned out to be the longest. When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of all in the caliphate of 'Umar, 
					we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of practicing charity, 
					so she was the first to follow the Prophet and she used to love to practice charity. 
					(Sauda died later in the caliphate of Muawiya).[<b>Bukhari</b>]					
				</li>
				<p>Now, why these things are kept in secret or tamseel?? .Becoz the events described in the hadith shall 
					happen at their fixed time &amp; at the same time, the person, in whose Heart the disease of "takabbur"
					( arrgancy, egoism) is not found, shall accept the 'manifested truth' &amp; the person, in whose Heart the disease of 
					"takabbur"( arrgancy, egoism) is found, shall reject the truth bcoz of the disease, thereby led astayed by ALLAH.</p>
