					<p>
						All praises belongs to ALLAH (SBT).He does what he wishes.No

						one can question Him for anything. He does not require anybodyâ€™s

						discussion or opinion. He is not constrained by anyone. He has no fear

						from anyone. Indeed, All praises belongs to Allah who dominates all and

						no one can ever dominate Him.
					</p>
					<h2>INTRODUCTON</h2>
					<p>
						Today the Muslims are eagerly waiting for the coming of Imam Mahdi (AS) but

						at the same time we should also know that there are quite differences among

						the Muslim community relating to the identification of Imam Mahdi (AS), the

						reason being some weak and fabricated narrations and some stories heard

						from here and there. Therefore in this article it has been tried to clear these

						misconceptions and present true things about Imam Mahdi (AS) so that each

						and every individual of this Ummah shall not reject true Imam mahdi (AS) due

						to his/her misconceptions and thus waiting of 1400 years going in vain.

						As we all know that Hazrat Imam Mahdi is one of the greatest signs before the

						last hour.(Qiyamah) and is one of famous personalities among muslims who

						are eagerly waiting for his coming.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many people across the world had claimed to be Mahdi but we eventually came to know that they were liars.
						Due to this, we muslims got a mindset that anyone claiming Mahdi would be false one and the true Mahdi's appearance
						is very far.
					</p>
					<p>
						But such thinking is not appropiate. If Prophet (SAW) has given the news of Mahdi's (AS) arrival then he will surely
						come &amp; it is our duty to recognize him and help him as Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said in one sahih hadith:
						<cite>&quot; Helping Mahdi for following his orders is must for every muslim.&quot; - (Abu Dawood)</cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						Now the question arises as how to identify the right Mahdi &amp; to realize the time of his coming(<em>appearance</em>)??

					<h2>PROPHECIES</h2>
					<p>
						Prophecies are the knowledge of unseen. People used to form opinion

						regarding the hadith related to prophecies. Hence, generally when

						the 'awaited' comes, they, instead of analysing the circumstances, at the time

						when the prophecies are unfolding with the actual words of Prophets, starts

						analysing the circumstances with the interpretation of their 'scholars'.

						Also, One cannot guarantee that the given hadith will happen in the way one

						has interpreted because prophecies are the knowledge of the unseen and

						before its happening one can only assume that it might happen in this way but

						cannot tell with full confidence that it will happen in the way assumed.

						Hence, one should only analyse the hadith related to prophecies at time when

						it is unfolding as per rules laid down in Quran &amp; sahi hadith.

						So, to know about imam mahdi first we must know what is hadith and

						prophecy and rules to understand the prophecies.
